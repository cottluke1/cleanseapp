                <p><strong>1.2 Images and Face Data</strong><br>Images of your face and skin that you upload so we can provide AI-powered skin analysis and routine recommendations. This may include facial features, skin texture, and other visible characteristics required for the analysis.

                <p><strong>1.3 Usage Data</strong><br>Information about how you interact with the Service, such as features used, session duration, device and operating system details, IP address, app version, crash logs, and similar diagnostic data.</p>
                
                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p><strong>2.1 Provide the Service</strong><br>To analyze your skin using AI models, generate ratings, and deliver personalized skincare routines.</p>
                <p><strong>2.2 Improve the Service</strong><br>To maintain, optimize, and enhance app performance and user experience (e.g., debugging, analytics on feature usage). Face data is not used for generic analytics or product improvement.</p>
                <p><strong>2.3 Communicate with You</strong><br>To send important notices about your account or the Service, and (if you opt in) marketing messages. You may opt out of marketing communications at any time.</p>
                <p><strong>2.4 Analytics (Non-Face Data)</strong><br>To understand aggregate user behavior and measure feature adoption. Face data is not used for analytics.</p>

                <h2>3. Data Processing and Sharing</h2>
                <p><strong>3.1 AI Processing by Trusted Providers</strong><br>To provide our core functionality, we transmit your images/face data securely to trusted third-party AI providers for processing.
