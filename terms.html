                <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Cleanse mobile application available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and our website [https://your-domain.example] (collectively, the “Service”) operated by [Company Name], LLC (“Cleanse,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

                <p><strong>1.4 No Interference.</strong> You agree not to access or use the Service in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair our servers, networks, or the experience of other users.</p>
                
                <h2>2. User Content</h2>
                <p><strong>2.1 Ownership.</strong> You retain ownership of content you submit to the Service, including images of your face/skin and any associated information (“User Content”).</p>
                <p><strong>2.2 License to Cleanse.</strong> By submitting User Content, you grant Cleanse a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, process, and display the User Content solely to operate, provide, maintain, and improve the Service.</p>
                <p><strong>2.3 Your Warranties.</strong> You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant the license above and that your User Content, and our use of it as permitted by these Terms, will not infringe any rights or violate any laws.</p>

                <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p><strong>3.1 Our Rights.</strong> The Service and all materials therein (excluding User Content), including software, features, text, graphics, logos, and trademarks, are owned by [Company Name], LLC and protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
                <p><strong>3.2 Restrictions.</strong> Except as expressly permitted by us, you may not copy, modify, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly display, or otherwise exploit any portion of the Service.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
                <p><strong>4.1 As-Is.</strong> The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. Cleanse disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
                <p><strong>4.2 No Medical Advice.</strong> Cleanse does not provide medical advice. Any skin analysis, scores, or routine recommendations are for informational purposes only and are not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified health provider with any questions regarding a medical condition.</p>
                <p><strong>4.3 No Guarantee.</strong> We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, error-free, or that defects will be corrected.</p>

                <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Cleanse shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising from or related to: (a) your use of or inability to use the Service; (b) unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein; (c) interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service; (d) bugs, viruses, Trojan horses, or similar that may be transmitted to or through the Service by a third party. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability; in such cases, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

                <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide notice (e.g., by posting in-app or on our website) at least 30 days before new terms take effect. What constitutes a material change is determined in our sole discretion. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

                <h2>7. Termination</h2>
                <p><strong>7.1 By Us.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the Service immediately, with or without notice, for any reason, including for breach of these Terms.</p>
                <p><strong>7.2 Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law, Indemnification) shall survive termination.</p>

                <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless [Company Name], LLC, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors from and against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (a) your access to or use of the Service; (b) your User Content; or (c) your breach of these Terms.</p>
                
                <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
                <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of [Your State/Country], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.</p>

                <h2>10. Severability</h2>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

                <h2>11. Entire Agreement</h2>
                <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding the Service.</p>
